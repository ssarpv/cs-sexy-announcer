# CSGO Sexy Announcer

## Why?
One day, I was watching a stream and the streamer mentioned that there used to be a mod to port Unreal Tournament Announcer sounds to CSGO. And so I decided to revive it best way I can

## Installing
1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run the exe
4. (Optional) Change the sound files to change the announcer
5. You can right-click the buh icon on the system tray to exit the program

## It stopped working :((
I don't usually write Python, so I'm not sure why the problem occurs. However, you can restart the program to fix it.
